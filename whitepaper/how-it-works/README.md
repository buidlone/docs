# ðŸ’¡ How it works?

Each project specifies the details:

* Milestones
* Funding needs
* Financial allocations according to the roadmap
* Rounds

Milestones have a pool for which investors or benefactors can enable new money streams. **Money streams** have specific financial targets to achieve so investors or benefactors can decide to continue streaming based on milestone completion or vote for project rejection.\
\
Funds allocated to the stream will not be deposited straight away, money is counted on a regular basis every second in proportionate installments. Investors can use their voting ticket to reject project funding if they are not happy with the overall results of the start-up.

### Project life cycle&#x20;

We created a visual schema to show life cycle of the project in build1 protocol. We cover all three phases - fundraising, execution and distribution.
