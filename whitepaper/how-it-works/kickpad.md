# 🌱Kickpad

*The goal of kickpad is to provide a space for innovative ideas to get the funding they need to become reality*

buidl1 kickpad is a DeFi platform that connects investors with start-up companies and commercial projects. It will list a variety of different types of projects, including both commercial and social good ventures. Investors will be able to browse the listings and choose which projects they would like to invest in. In addition to providing much-needed financial support, investors will also be able to play a role in shaping the future of new businesses. 

## Project view

Before a project goes public, they must state an official roadmap. This roadmap will include road map steps with certain points and fundraising needs. 
**The project's owners can use the functions below to help with this process:**

 🌿  Real time balance
 
 🌿  Monthly net flow
 
 🌿  Available balance to withdraw
 
 🌿  Outgoing investments
 
 🌿  Incoming investments
 
 🌿  Project environment
 

After the project goes public, there will be private sales and public sales. The project's owners can still use the functions above to keep track of the project's progress. Thanks to these functions, it will be easier for the owners to see how well their project is doing and where improvements need to be made. 

One of the unique features of buidl1 is its ability to list projects on Kickpad. This allows users to easily keep track of their progress on multiple projects, as well as view and update project details from one central location. In addition, buidl1's integration with Kickpad makes it easy to share projects with team members and customers, collaborate on project tasks, and receive real-time notifications when project milestones are reached. 

As a result, buidl1 is an invaluable tool for anyone who needs to manage multiple projects at once. It makes it easy to stay organized and on track. 

## Investors view

By allowing investors to see exactly what projects are looking for funding and how that funding will be used, Kickpad provides an unprecedented level of transparency. And due to each project having its own Investment Pool, investors can choose to back only the projects they believe in. 

**Each project specifies the details:**

 🌿  Roadmap
 
 🌿  Funding needs and allocations according to the roadmap.
 

Any investors looking to get involved in a new cryptocurrency project can now do so without any of the usual volatility associated with the market by simply transferring stable cryptocurrency such as `$USDT`, `$USDC`, or `$DAI` to the project Investment Pool. 

The pool will be locked until the project's soft cap is reached and if the soft cap is not reached, the coins will be refunded. This allows investors to get involved in a project without having to worry about the value of their investment fluctuating. As more and more projects launch - this type of investment pool is likely to become increasingly popular. 

*Who will decide when the project has not reached its milestone?  Let's talk about DAO with the power that comes with it! *
