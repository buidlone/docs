## Dictionary

 ðŸ“– **Investment pool factory** - creates investment pools on demand with a certain specified property
 
 ðŸ“– **Distribution contract** - the contract that ends up sending asset streams to the Creator's account. In the direct locking model - it will be the "Investment Pool" itself
 
 ðŸ“– **Investment pool** - allows investors to invest money during the fundraiser period

 ðŸ“– **Successful fundraiser** - total amount of collected investments is more than or equal to soft cap
 
 ðŸ“– **Failed fundraiser** - necessary number of investments was not raised in time, investors are eligible for refunds
 
 ðŸ“– **Voting period** - a period where investors vote on milestone completion result. This will determine if project funding continues during the next milestone period. During the voting period, a project will still receive funding for the previous milestone
 
 ðŸ“– **Termination window** - a short window of time, when the money stream from the contract to the creator address can be terminated, and all leftover funds are instantly transferred to the creator's account. This is necessary to prevent the contract going over its balance and being jailed, thus losing the buffer of funds that were reserved for streaming to Superfluid's 3P system (Patricians, Plebs, Pirates).
