## Milestones

**We present a new approach for managing incoming projects:**

🏆 Projects will receive more trust as all projects listed in the platform will have live roadmaps, clear vision, pre-planned funding allocations based on goals so that will increase the overall trust of investors even if the project is in the early stage.

🏆 Projects can efficiently manage their money flow since they can track them in real-time.

🏆 Roadmap goals are defined and linked to financial projections which can be visible and easily tracked by potential investors through our ecosystem.

## Investment

Our platform will list all projects in one place where investors will be able to see existing or new investment opportunities and buidl1 will help investors to be in control of their investments by offering them funding stream opportunities based on project goals.

Investors can see the full scope of the project in advance and invest into specific roadmap steps accordingly - with the opportunity to stop or continue funding streams depending on how the project is evolving during the whole implementation process.
