## Trust problem
****

Investors are naturally wary of putting their money into something that hasn't been proven yet. Early-stage projects can lack investors' trust because they haven't weathered any storms or faced any challenges.

Having multiple capital sources means you're not totally reliant on any source. This can help to build trust with investors, as they will see that you're not putting all your eggs in one basket.  

Additionally, diversified funding can help to insulate you against unexpected challenges. If one funding source dries up, you will still have others to fall back on. In today's uncertain world, having a solid and diversified financial foundation is more critical than ever.
