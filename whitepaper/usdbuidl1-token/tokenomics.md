# Tokenomics

### LCFI Model:

We present The Linear Cash Flow from Investment model which is an improvement on the current user incentives model.

It will allow users to get rewards in real-time, to their wallets, on the Layer1 blockchain, without any additional payout collection procedure. Generally speaking, $BUIDL1 holders will receive rewards instantly to their wallet address without any collection procedure that usually requires paying applicable network (gas) fees.
