## Trust problem

Investors are naturally wary of putting their money into something that hasn't been proven yet. Early-stage projects can lack the trust of investors because they haven't weathered any storms or faced any challenges.&#x20;

Having multiple sources of capital means that you're not totally reliant on any particular source. This can help to build trust with investors, as they will see that you're not putting all your eggs in one basket.&#x20;

Additionally, diversified funding can help to insulate you against unexpected market changes. If one source of funding dries up, you will still have others to rely on. In today's uncertain world, having a strong and diversified financial foundation is more important than ever.

**Trust problem for both parties, that's what we want to change**
