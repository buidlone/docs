# DAO treasury

The Linear Cash Flow protocol incentivizes users to participate in the DAO treasury pool by providing them with rewards from the pool. The DAO treasury pool is operated by the community, and the decision makers are the $BUIDL1 token holders.

### Pool Allocations&#x20;

The initial allocation for the pool is as follows:

| Precentage | Entity            | Purpose                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 50%        | $BUIDL1 buyback   | The buyback will be conducted over the course of two weeks                                 |
| 35%        | DAO ventures      | DAO ventures purpose is to reinvest in to community project's which has a great potential. |
| 15%        | Operating service | Operating service for maintenance and development expenses                                 |

This unique approach to tokenomics ensures that users are rewarded for their participation in the DAO, while also providing funding for ongoing DAO operations.

This funding model ensures that the DAO can continue to provide valuable services to its members, while also incentivizing participation in the governance of the organization.
