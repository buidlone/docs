# Tokenomics

### LCFI Model:

We present The Linear Cash Flow from Investment model which is an improvement on the current user incentives model.

It will allow users to get rewards in real time, on their wallets, on Layer1 blockchain, without any collection procedure. This will be a great opportunity for $BUIDL1 holders to get rewards instantly by using the Linear Cash Flow protocol. This approach will allow them to get rewards directly to their wallets on blockchain, without having to go through any collection procedure.
