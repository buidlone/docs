## Lack of Trust

Early-stage projects often lack trust in the eyes of investors because they have not been battle-tested. They have not weathered any storms and donâ€™t have a track record of success. Therefore, itâ€™s important to have diversified funding streams so that youâ€™re not totally reliant on one source of capital. 

When you have multiple streams of funding, it sends a signal to investors that youâ€™re a safe bet. They know that even if one stream dries up, youâ€™ll still be able to keep the lights on. So, if youâ€™re looking to raise money for your project, make sure you have a diversified approach. It will go a long way in building trust with potential investors. 

One of the biggest factors that affect giving is - trust from the public when scandals take place in space. In many cases, early-stage projects do not have diversified funding streams. When you have multiple ways to raise funds, youâ€™ll never be strapped for cash. 

## Show your MVP

An early-stage pre-revenue start-up will have no record of its cash flow and revenues, which might indicate a considerable risk for investors. 

Believing in a concept with no present success is not easy. Projects need to find the right angel investor or benefactor who believes in the start-up or who has experience in this domain so that they can provide mentorship as well as some initial funding. 

The pressure is on the start-up to then create a working prototype or MVP fast so they can start generating revenue and show some ROI to their early investors. Many starting projects fail because they are not able to achieve this within a reasonable timeframe and run out of money before they can get to this stage. 

Therefore, it is crucial to have a well-thought-out plan and timeline for your project so that you can secure the necessary funding and avoid pitfalls along the way. By clearly understanding the risks and challenges involved in starting up a new business, you can increase your chances of success. 

## Milestones =  Financial allocation

When it comes to raising capital, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Every start-up is different and will require a unique approach when it comes to finding the right investors and securing funding. However, there are some common challenges that entrepreneurs face when they first start building their start-ups. 

Building a strong enough team to attract investment is one of the biggest challenges. This can be difficult, especially when the start-up is still finding its footing in the early stages. Another common challenge is developing a clear and compelling pitch to present to potential investors. Again, this can be a challenge if the start-up does not have a clear roadmap or if the financial projections are not well defined. 

However, with careful planning and preparation, these obstacles can be overcome, and the start-up can successfully secure the funding it needs to grow and thrive.
