As a result, you can save time and reduce costs associated with traditional methods of asset transfer. The Linear Cash Flow protocol is an innovative way to move assets on-chain and provides a number of advantages over traditional methods.

It is important to note that tokens allocated to the flow will not be deposited straight away. Instead, money is counted on a regular basis every second in proportionate installments. If investors are not happy with the overall results of the project, they can stop funding by voting for project rejection. This system ensures that projects are held accountable and that investors can recoup their funds if necessary. As a result, it is an important safeguard for both investors and project organizers.
