# 🗳️Voting pool

*Each project has a threshold that indicates project failure required percentage of votes*

Voting systems allow all team members to weigh in on deadlines and deliverables, ensuring that everyone is on the same page. In addition, they provide a transparent record of all decisions that have been made, making it easy to track progress and identify any potential issues. As a result, voting systems are an invaluable tool for keeping large projects on track.  

## Rejection Tickets

Every investor will get **Rejection Tickets** as NFT tokens that can be used at any time during a project lifetime to stop the project funding. If you have Rejection Tickets, you have an active vote to reject the project (this tool works as a scam/fraud preventor). Thus, the new generation web3 projects will be more truthful and not give impossible promises to their future investors. 

### Burn your ticket

**Rejection Tickets** can be burned if you choose to believe in the project execution. You will ease to have a rejection vote for that project; however, you will be rewarded with start-up tokens for your shown trust. 

### How it works:

 📌 Each project has a threshold that indicates project failure required in percentage of votes 
 
 📌 The Voting pool only has **Rejection Ticket**s, which means - if you do not participate in the Voting pool, you will be counted as a positive vote 
 
 📌 If the rejection percentage is reached, then the project funding is stopped, and the locked raised capital will be returned to investors. 
 
 📌 If the rejection percentage is not reached - the project continues its growth 

This system provides a fail-safe for companies, ensuring that nothing gets overlooked. It's a simple but effective way to get everyone on board and work towards the same goal.
