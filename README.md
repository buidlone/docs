# What is buidl1?

### TL;DR -  We are an integrable protocol that secures invested capital in web3 projects. No more scams, no more rug pulls

buidl1 is the first to implement Linear Cash Flow, a blockchain protocol that mitigates investment risk and stabilizes project funding.&#x20;

We propose a better way to invest in web3 projects, which will benefit investors and projects at the same time&#x20;

* **Investor**: Investors can use their voting ticket to reject project funding if they are not unsatisfied with the overall results of the web3 start-up.
* **Project**: Projects will receive more trust as all projects listed in the protocol will have live roadmaps, clear vision, and pre-planned funding allocations based on goals so which will increase the overall trust of investors even if the project is in the early stage.



Take a look at the innovative Linear Cash Flow Financing Model:
