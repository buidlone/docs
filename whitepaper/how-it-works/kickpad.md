# Investment Portfolio

_The goal of the_ Investment Portfolio _is to provide a space for aggregated investments in the projects through LCF protocol._

buidl1 Investment Portfolio is a DeFi aggregator that tracks every web3 investment to companies and commercial projects. It will list a variety of different types of projects, including both commercial and social good ventures. Investors will be able to browse the listings and choose which projects they would like to invest in. In addition to providing much-needed financial support, investors will also be able to play a role in shaping the future of new businesses.

## Investors view

By allowing investors to see exactly what projects are looking for funding and how that funding will be used, Investment Portfolio provides an unprecedented level of transparency due to each project having its own Investment Pool.

This allows users to easily keep track of their progress on multiple projects, as well as view and update project details from one central location. In addition, buidl1's integration with launchpads makes it easy to share projects with team members, and customers, and receive real-time notifications when project milestones are reached.

As a result, buidl1 is an invaluable tool for anyone who needs to manage multiple projects at once. It makes it easy to stay organized and on track.

**Each investor has a panel with specified details:**

ðŸŒ¿ Project name

ðŸŒ¿ Invested amount

ðŸŒ¿ Used investments

ðŸŒ¿ Voting power

ðŸŒ¿ Percentage of Voted against the project

Any investors looking to get involved in a new cryptocurrency project can now do so without any of the usual volatility associated with the market by simply transferring stable cryptocurrency such as `$USDT`, `$USDC`, or `$DAI` to the project Investment Pool.

The pool will be locked until the project's soft cap is reached and if the soft cap is not reached, the coins will be refunded. This allows investors to get involved in a project without having to worry about the value of their investment fluctuating. As more and more projects launch - this type of investment pool is likely to become increasingly popular.
