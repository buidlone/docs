# ðŸ’¡ How it works?

Funds allocated to the stream will not be deposited straight away, money is counted on a regular basis every second in proportionate installments. Investors can use their voting ticket to reject project funding if they are not happy with the overall results of the start-up.

## Project life cycle

We created a visual schema to show the life cycle of the project in build1 protocol. We cover all three phases - fundraising, execution and distribution.
