# Milestones

**buidl1 is a new take on the traditional investment model, and as such, will have a unique approach to investor allocations.**

Meeting deadlines is essential to the success of any large project. However, coordinating between different departments and team members can often be a challenge. That's why many companies are now turning to voting systems to help ensure that all milestones are met. Voting systems allow all team members to weigh in on deadlines and deliverables, ensuring that everyone is on the same page. In addition, voting systems provide a transparent record of all decisions that have been made, making it easy to track progress and identify any potential issues. As a result, voting systems are an invaluable tool for keeping large projects on track.

### Milestone Voting

For each milestone step, buidl1 will lock a specific amount of tokens and distribute them according to the road map. This approach will help to ensure that all investors are able to see the potential return on their investment, while also providing flexibility for those who may want to exit early. By aligning the interests of all parties involved, buidl1 aims to create a win-win situation for everyone involved.

#### **Here's how it works**:

Each milestone is assigned a required percentage of votes.

ðŸŸ¢ If that percentage is reached, then the milestone is marked as successfully completed and all locked tokens with rewards are returned.&#x20;

ðŸ”´ However, if the required percentage is not reached, then the milestone is not marked as completed and all locked tokens are returned.&#x20;

This system provides a fail-safe for companies, ensuring that nothing gets overlooked. It's a simple but effective way to get everyone on board and working towards the same goal.
