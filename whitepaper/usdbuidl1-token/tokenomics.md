## LCFI Model

We present The Linear Cash Flow from Investment model which is an improvement on the current user incentives model. 

It will allow users to get rewards in real time to their wallets without any collection procedure (while remaining on Layer1 blockchain). This will be a great opportunity for `$BUIDL1` holders to get rewards instantly by using the LCF protocol.
