# Linear Cash Flow (LCF) protocol

Linear Cash Flow is a constant flow of transactions that are executed automatically every time a new block is minted on the blockchain. These transfers are finalized simultaneously, meaning that there is no need for manual intervention or approval from a third party. This makes Linear Cash Flow an ideal solution for businesses that need to send large amounts of money on a regular basis. With Linear Cash Flow, businesses can be confident that their transactions will be processed quickly and efficiently. Thus, its protocol offers regular investors a higher degree of safety by spreading investments out over time.

This type of cash flow has the potential to revolutionize the way that businesses and organizations operate. As more people learn about Linear Cash Flow (LCF), it will likely become more popular and mainstream.

## Layer 1 solution

LCF is a new concept in the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. It is a type of cash flow that is made on the protocol side by an Investment pool.

This allows for reducing the risk from the Investor side and ensures stable funds for projects. The pooling of resources helps reduce the volatility often seen with cryptocurrency assets. In addition, LCF can help to ensure that projects have the necessary funding to continue operating.

The Linear Cash Flow protocol enables you to move assets on-chain following predefined rules called - agreements. With a single on-chain transaction, the money will flow from your wallet to the receiver in real-time. No further transactions are required. The Smart contract framework works on Layer 1 Ethereum, using **SuperFluid protocol**

## Benefits

**LCF protocol benefits:**

ðŸ“£ Save time and money on traditional methods of asset transfer

ðŸ“£ Identify the conditions for releasing payments and automate the process

ðŸ“£ Reduce costs associated with traditional methods of asset transfer

ðŸ“£ Move assets on-chain quickly and easily

LCF protocol enables you to identify the conditions for releasing payments and automate the entire process. As a result, you can save time and reduce costs associated with traditional methods of asset transfer.

It is important to note that tokens allocated to the flow will not be deposited straight away. Instead, money is counted on a regular basis every second in proportionate instalments. If investors are not happy with the overall results of the project, they can stop funding by proposing emergency fraud voting. This system ensures that projects are held accountable and that investors can recoup their funds if necessary. As a result, it is an important safeguard for both investors and project organizers.

## Real-time balances

LCF has new way of handling project financing that allows for the transfer of money as it is received, at every block. This potentially enables projects and investors to operate with no working capital or delays in payments. The protocol is based on the simple concept of allowing money to flow in a linear fashion, from one party to another, as it is generated. This could potentially revolutionize the way projects are funded, as it would allow for a more efficient use of resources and eliminate the need for waiting periods or interim funding.

This protocol is still in its early stages of development, but it has already attracted the attention of some major players in the world of finance. If it continues to gain traction, it could have a significant impact on the way projects are funded in the future.
