## $BUIDL1 - let's build a future together

`$BUIDL1` is an **ERC777** token, which has a compatible feature for LCF protocol to work. The main advantage of ERC777 is the ability to handle tokens that represent actual value, like stable currencies. In addition, it also allows for the development of smart contracts that can send and receive payments in multiple currencies. This makes it an ideal choice for businesses that need to accept payments in multiple currencies.

Lastly, **ERC777** is also backward compatible with **ERC20**, meaning that it can be used on Ethereum's existing network without any changes. This makes it a very attractive option for businesses and developers looking to adopt Ethereum's blockchain technology.
